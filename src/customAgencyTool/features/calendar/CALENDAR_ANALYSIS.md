# Calendar Feature Analysis

## 1. Implemented Requirements (Original)

The calendar feature initially included the following functionalities:

*   **Event Management:** Users can create, read, update, and delete calendar events.
*   **Multiple Views:** The calendar supports multiple views, including month, week, day, and list.
*   **Time Zone Support:** The calendar has basic time zone support, allowing users to view events in their local time.
*   **National Holidays:** The calendar displays national holidays for Costa Rica.

## 2. Newly Implemented Features

The following features were added to enhance the calendar's functionality:

*   **Time Zone Control:** A time zone selector has been re-enabled, allowing users to change the calendar's time zone dynamically.
*   **Weekday Highlighting:** Users can now highlight specific days of the week with a custom color. This is useful for emphasizing workdays, weekends, or other recurring patterns.
*   **Birthday Highlighting:** The calendar now displays birthdays, which are highlighted with a distinct background color. The data is currently mocked but can be easily replaced with real data from a user service.

## 3. Component Distribution

The calendar feature is organized into the following layers:

*   **`presentation`:** This layer contains the UI components, pages, and routes for the calendar feature.
    *   **`components`:** Reusable UI components, such as `CalendarPanel` and `BtnEventOnCalendar`.
    *   **`pages`:** The main calendar page, which integrates the different components.
*   **`application`:** This layer contains the business logic for the calendar feature.
    *   **`useCase`:** Use cases for creating, reading, updating, and deleting calendar events.
*   **`domain`:** This layer contains the entities and models for the calendar feature.
    *   **`calendarEvent.entity.ts`:** The main entity for calendar events.
*   **`infrastructure`:** This layer contains the implementation of the data access logic.

## 4. Features for Improvement

The following features could be improved in the future:

*   **Real-time Updates:** While the `onCalendarUpdateUseCase` suggests real-time functionality, the implementation could be enhanced to provide a more seamless experience.
*   **User Integration:** The birthday highlighting feature currently uses mock data. Integrating with a real user service would make this feature much more useful.
*   **Recurring Events:** The calendar does not currently support recurring events. Adding this functionality would be a significant improvement.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:** The UI could be improved with features like drag-and-drop event creation, more intuitive event editing, and better mobile responsiveness.
*   **Testing:** The feature lacks automated tests. Adding unit and integration tests would improve the code's quality and maintainability.
